      All file edits must be performed using the `ai_edit` MCP tool. Do not use `apply_diff`, `write_to_file`, `insert_content`, or `search_and_replace` for code modifications.
      When making changes, provide a clear and concise message to the `ai_edit` tool describing the desired outcome, including specific files to modify if known.
